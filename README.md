# Finance Manager SAAS
My finance manager is made with HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP and SQL (mariaDB), which is what i’m currently studying at school. I used to use a google spreadsheet but i didn’t like it, so i made my own web application.
It’s currently working with its main features but I’m planning to add more.
